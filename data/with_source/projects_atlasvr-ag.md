SPH Project: AtlasVR AG
__AtlasVR AG__ was founded in the end of 2021 by Joy, Valentin and Christian, three PhD students at the Innovation Center Virtual Reality. Our vision is to revolutionize vocational training procedures by harnessing the immense socioeconomic potential of Virtual Reality (VR) technology. Our VR training solutions enable active learning with an intuitive learning-by-doing approach, saving substantial costs compared to real world training, while increasing trainee motivation and engagement. We entirely focus on a B2B model, specifically in the Swiss MEM industries as our target customers. With our end-to-end offering, we accompany our customers from initial contact with the technology via implementation to on-site roll-out with options for service maintenance long after development. We are currently implementing and refining our pilot projects and demonstrators and work with our first customers on their individualized training solutions.
