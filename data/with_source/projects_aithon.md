SPH Project: AITHON
[None](https://aris-space.ch/sage-cubesat/)We build __flying robots__ for force-intensive tasks! This saves workers lives and improves construction site efficiency.

In Switzerland alone, over __9000 construction workers injure themselves severely through falling. AITHON has seen this issue and has created a flying robot to drill holes and perform other manipulative tasks on concrete walls. Not only can we create forces of up to 150 Newton__ horizontally, but also apply these forces with millimetre-precision.

Besides keeping the construction worker out of harms way this can improve efficiency, by eliminating the need for scaffolding.

By working on our team, you can apply yourself to many different fields, as we build our own hardware, controlled by our own software! \\nIf you are interested in supporting us, feel free to contact us anytime to talk about partnerships!
