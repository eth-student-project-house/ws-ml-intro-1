SPH Project: We do it for Awá
Northern Brazil, state of Maranhao. TIBA architects build earth houses in indigenous villages as a part of a compensation policy against the impact of an industrial railway which passes next to the territory. Architecture then becomes a pretext to talk about the complex situation of the native Brazilian population which faces rapid modernization of its culture and an intensifying invasion from neighbouring Brazilian villages. The efforts of the Guajajara tribe focus on guarding the forest and ensuring that the last uncontacted Awa tribes can continue their traditional way of life, undisturbed.
