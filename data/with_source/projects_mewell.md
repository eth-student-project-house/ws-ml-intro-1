SPH Project: MEWELL
MeWell is a young student and staff organization with the focus on providing both professional and community-focused activities around raising awareness of mental wellbeing and fighting metal health stigma at the universities in Zurich.

For this purpose, MeWell offers a range of engaging activities focused on fighting mental health stigma in academia. Our events cover two main areas:

#### 1. Mental health awareness

Our mental health awareness program consists of educational activities which inform and teach our community about various aspects of mental health such as: promoting mental wellbeing, recognizing the signs and symptoms of poor mental health, and talks covering current research. Each month, we tackle a different topic together with an expert in the field.

#### 2. Community outreach social events

Our community outreach events offer an opportunity for our community to directly interact with each other and our team. This serves three main purposes:  

1.   As a direct program to engage our community in a safe space and improve mental health through fun community activities.
2.   To potentially help redirect people to professional support organizations in case of poor mental health.
3.   As a recruitment and team development program.
