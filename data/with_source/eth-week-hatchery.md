ETH Week Hatchery

During ETH Week 2022, you will focus on the topic of "Urban Futures".  
After an exciting ETH week, with a problem and an idea for a solution in your pocket, you ask yourself the following question:

__  
__

__How can I take it one step further and even turn it into a concept?__  

We'll help you take your idea to the next level - join the Hatchery!

This nine-week programme takes you into the Student Project House, an ecosystem that nurtures the next generation of makers and innovators. The results of your Hatchery experience can be many, such as a functional prototype, a valuable user test, or even a new concept!

Over the course of nine weeks, you will have the opportunity to participate in four Hatchery events focused on your individual project work, supported by coaching. We will help you start your project and give you further inputs on design thinking and other tools. Together we will identify your goals, define the next steps and how you can achieve them. At the final event, you will have the opportunity to present your results to a larger audience in a cheerful and supportive environment.

# What can you expect?  

You'll experience teamwork on a whole new level thanks to our passionate coaches and some collaboration magic tricks. A strong community of creative minds, weekly workshops and events, a grant towards project costs and access to relevant experts from academia and business provide an environment where you can bring your ideas to life.
