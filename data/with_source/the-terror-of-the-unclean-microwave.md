The Terror of the Unclean Microwave

It was a dark and stormy night, and a group of SPH students were hunched over their project work in the student lounge, trying to finish before the deadline. As the clock ticked closer to midnight, their stomachs began to grumble, and they remembered that they had leftovers in the fridge.

They trudged over to the community microwave and popped in their Tupperware containers, setting the timer for two minutes. As the microwave hummed and whirred, the students returned to their work, their minds far from the mundane task of heating up leftovers.

But little did the students know, they were not alone in the student lounge. Something was lurking in the shadows, watching them with hungry eyes. Something that had been waiting for this moment, this chance to strike.

As the microwave timer beeped, the students got up to retrieve their food. But as they opened the door, they were greeted with a sight that froze them in their tracks. The inside of the microwave was a writhing mass of tentacles, pulsating and writhing as if alive. And as the students stared in horror, the tentacles seemed to reach out towards them, as if inviting them to join them in the darkness.

Trembling with fear, the students backed away from the microwave, their hearts pounding in their chests. They knew that they should have cleaned the microwave after using it, as the community rules stated. But it was too late for regrets now. The damage was done, and the microwave monster had been unleashed.

One of the students, overcome with terror, stumbled and fell to the ground. The microwave monster, sensing an opportunity, lunged forward and enveloped the student in its tentacles. The student screamed in terror as the tentacles wrapped around them, pulling them towards the darkness of the microwave. The other students watched in horror as their friend was consumed by the monster, their screams echoing through the student lounge.

And then, just as suddenly as it had appeared, the microwave monster retreated back into the darkness, leaving behind only a small, charred piece of the student. The surviving students, their hearts heavy with grief and guilt, fled from the student lounge, never to return. They knew that they had escaped the clutches of the microwave monster, but they also knew that it would be waiting for them, or for some other unsuspecting victim, the next time someone forgot to clean the microwave.

The students never worked in SPH again, haunted by the memory of their fallen friend and the terror of the microwave monster. And so, they dispersed to different parts of the world, seeking to put the horrors of that fateful night behind them. But the memory of the microwave monster lived on, a cautionary tale for all those who dared to neglect their cleaning duties in the community kitchen.
