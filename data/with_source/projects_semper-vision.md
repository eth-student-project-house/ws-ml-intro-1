SPH Project: Semper Vision
Semper Vision builds smart bike cams that track rides, automatically generate video snippets of accidents/dangerous moments and aggregate data points for urban analytics.

At the moment, we are mainly focused on our bike/scooter cam for individuals, insurance companies, and fleet businesses. In the long-term, however, we want to adapt the cams for usage in cars and public transport vehicles as well. It is our vision to build a dense network of smart cams that provides real-time insight into cities by continuously aggregating various data points (video recordings, traffic and road conditions, air quality, etc.). Such a network can be used to build useful services like, for example, a maps service with different data layers or city dashboards.
