Many students with parents from non-academic backgrounds or from underprivileged households do not have the resources to seek extra tutoring and do not have the possibility of optimal academic guidance at home. Some students face learning challenges like ADHD or Dyslexia.  

These students are more likely to underperform at school and schools may not have dedicated resources to target and uplift these students. Eventually, the students fall out of the track to pursue an academic degree and may never realise their true potential. ERducation is looking to help students in this quest.
