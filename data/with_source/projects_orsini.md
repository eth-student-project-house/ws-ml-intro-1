SPH Project: Orsini
__Orsini Ginger Liqueur__ – hand-crafted locally here in Zürich. It shines like the sun and embraces the spicy-sweet taste of ginger. It’s refreshing, but also spends warmth, which is perfect for heating up a snowy winter night. Meet__ the Orsini Team__ - Oli, Sophia and Lukas. We met in the big student house at Meierhofplatz in Höngg where we’ve been crafting Ginger Liqueur for a couple years now. This fall, however, we decided we will upgrade our hobby to a small business and bring what we love to the world: A Ginger Liqueur that unfolds its full potential at an affordable price.
