SPH Project: Circular Horizon
Circular Horizon is an association of around 40 bachelor’s, master’s, and Ph.D. students from various study fields spread across universities in Switzerland. We strive to contribute to the climate challenge by building and scaling a sustainable and innovative carbon dioxide removal technology.We are currently developing a prototype for a pyrolysis reactor that is able to process biowaste to biochar.
