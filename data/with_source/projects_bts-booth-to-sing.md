SPH Project: BTS - Booth To Sing
Booth To Sing is a project to create a Karaoke booth for small groups of people. Similar to a telephone booth where people could come in and insert coins (like a vending machine) to sing a few songs of their choice. Initially, the idea is to distribute these booths across the ETH campus, but the project could also be extended so that these booths will become available in the city of Zurich.
