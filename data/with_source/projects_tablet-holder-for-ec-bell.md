SPH Project: Tablet holder for EC Bell
In many ways, our everyday lives have become smart and digital. The healthcare industry is also rapidly advancing towards digitalization. Paton, a startup, has developed an "EC-Bell" digital nurse call system, but despite this progress, there is still a missing piece in the patient room - a suitable tablet holder.

To address this need, we have developed a 3D-printed design that can be attached to any "Schwanenhals" of a hospital bed. Our design was successfully tested during the pilot phase for the EC-Bell system in a hospital. It provides a robust and flexible solution for a tablet at the patient's bedside, allowing tablets to be positioned at the perfect angle for various applications.

By using our solution, patients can access their tablets easily and comfortably while resting in bed, improving their overall well-being during their stay at the hospital.
