SPH Project: Thinkers & Makers Podcast
Thinkers and Makers are the people who move Europe towards a better, brighter future. Thinkers come up with new ideas, driving technological innovation and scientific progress. Makers take these ideas and turn them into tangible progress, improving peoples’ everyday lives.

In each episode of the Thinkers and Makers podcast, I sit down with a Thinker or Maker from Europe, typically a scientist or start-up founder, and try to understand their journey. What inspired them to start? What helped them keep going? What are they aspiring to in the future?

Each episode dives into one individual’s journey with hopes of sparking an inspiring and enriching conversation for listeners who want to help build a better Europe for all.
