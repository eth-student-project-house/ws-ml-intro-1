<p>Since Spring 2021, every semester start, the team at SPH takes the opportunity to learn more about the projects they support and their plans, as well as gather their opinions in a standardised way. As a result, we have collected significant data on the growth and impact of our projects.</p>
<p>The data is nothing short of impressive. According to the latest figures, SPH has been able to grow their project population by a factor of 6 since 2021 while maintaining high-quality services and a stable net promoter score in the excellent range.</p>

<p>In 2022, the SPH supported a total of 286 projects. Of these, 249 have re-registered for this semester. We are pleased to continue to have a total of 900+ team members. What’s more, 60-70% of these projects serve or have served an environmental or social purpose. </p>
<p>Based on the latest data, the most important services offered by SPH to our projects are the co-working space, networking/community, and coaching. This is a notable shift from previous years, as coaching has been the most important service in the past.<br /></p>

<p>Project members are continuing to prioritise product development as a key focus area. It's also interesting to note that the need to acquire funding or investments has increased. This may reflect a growing awareness among project members of the importance of securing financial support in order to scale their projects and bring their products to market.</p>
<p>Overall, the continued focus on early-stage characteristics of projects suggests that SPH remains a hub for innovation and experimentation, where project members can receive the support and resources they need to develop and launch new ideas. It will be exciting to see how these projects continue to evolve and grow in the coming months and years.<em><br /></em></p>
