SPH Project: Planet Gotcha
Planet Gotcha aimed at developing an app offering easy and fun challenges on how to incorporate climate action into your daily life. The challenges tackle sustainability issues, from zero waste to mobility. With each of these challenges you can measure your positive impact/progress in carbon points. We want to show that individual action matters and that every step is a step in the right direction. Take a challenge, start somewhere.
