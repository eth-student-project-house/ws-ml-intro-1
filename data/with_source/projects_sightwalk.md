SPH Project: Sightwalk
Sightwalk is an app-guided sightseeing platform that empowers everyone from travel lovers to professional tour guides or travel influencers to create digital tours for travelers around the world.

Without any travel preparation in advance, Sightwalk guides any user that starts a tour from one sight to the other and displays all of the tour creator's uniquely created content throughout the tour.

We are currently testing our first app version and would love to have you as one of the first testers! Just sign up on our website and we'll reach out to you with all the necessary details. Thanks so much and we're looking forward to your feedback :)
