SPH Project: Tomorrow Kids
The Tomorrow Kids is a children's television show that aims to make early childhood education accessible for all learners in their first language. Think: Sesame Street of Nepal! Tomorrow Kids is transforming education in Nepal by supporting early childhood development (literacy, numeracy), addressing relevant social concerns, and making education accessible in all Nepali languages. Our goal is to reach all Nepali learners (ages 3-11) by dubbing the show into each of the 123 languages spoken in the country. We're prioritizing speakers of minority languages, as they are the ones who have been left behind in education in Nepal.

The Tomorrow Kids was founded by Madison Coakley, an American linguist and student of international development in Switzerland who has spent the past five years researching mother tongue education in Nepal, inspired by the many years she spent traveling to the country. Otherwise, the Tomorrow Kids is completely Nepali-led!
