SPH Project: m達
<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>M達</strong> is an innovative project at the university that aims to introduce children to the world of engineering and design. The project focuses on developing a domino machine kit that can automatically set up 10 dominos after they are pushed over. The kit is designed to be both educational and fun, providing an exciting way for children to learn about physics, engineering, and mechanics, and help them develop problem-solving skills.<br/>

The kit is built using a combination of 3D printing, laser cutting, and electronics. The user manual provides detailed instructions and suggestions to help children get started with building and exploring the kit. The kit is designed to be both educational and fun, providing children with a hands-on learning experience that promotes creativity and problem-solving.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, M達 is a fantastic example of how innovation and education can come together to create something truly exciting and beneficial for children. By providing a hands-on learning experience, the kit inspires children to explore the world of engineering and design while promoting sustainability and creativity.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
