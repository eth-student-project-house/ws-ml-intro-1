SPH Project: Tri-Max
Prevention is the best way to reduce health costs having great effects on patients. Tri-Max is the first fitness mat that helps and corrects users with simple vocal and visual advice. Through pressure sensors, Tri-max detects the patient's posture and determines whether it is right. Furthermore, an AI algorithm allows Tri-Max to learn all slight posture variation.

Tri-Max connects with the user's smartphone. With Tri-Max App, users can select specific training that matches their age, fitness level, and desired duration of training. Eventually, all training data are stored in the app and can be shared with the physiotherapist that can further consult patients and improve the therapy.
