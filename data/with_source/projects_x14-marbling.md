SPH Project: x14 marbling
X14 foods enables food companies in producing the most delicious meat analogues! Replicating the mouthfeel and juiciness of meat comes down to structuring protein sources and marbling fat.

We have developed a tool allowing plant-based and cell-based formulations to be structured and marbled and are looking for interested and motivated students to join our take on making impact through food!
