SPH Project: LEMNA PRO
LemnaPro develops a technology that enables the sustainable and economic cultivation of Wolffia for human nutrition.

Wolffia is a water plant with high levels of protein and a very rapid growth. It has traditionally been harvested and consumed in Asia. It is our aim to introduce it to Europe as a healthy and delicious food ingredient.

The introduction of this novel crop into our food system will alleviate the pressure on natural resources related to protein production today.

To achieve our aim in light of the above we are developing a tailored hydroponic system for Wolffia, which currently already yields 20 times more protein per area than soy.
