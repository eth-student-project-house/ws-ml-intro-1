SPH Project: ROWCUS
Rowcus is a collision avoidance radar tailored to the needs of rowers. It watches out when you cannot. In darkness, fog, glaring light or simply when you fail to turn around.

Thanks to the integrated radar sensor and state of the art object detection and tracking algorithms, rowcus is aware of potentially dangerous obstacles. Be it other boats, buoys, swimmers, SUPs, metal poles, the shore or just a brave duck.

Rowcus is also able to classify objects, which allows it to separate harmless waves from potentially dangerous objects.Thanks to the integrated radar sensor and state of the art object detection and tracking algorithms, rowcus is aware of potentially dangerous obstacles.
