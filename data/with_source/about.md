About

ETH Student Project House (SPH) was built with a singular vision â€“ to be a dynamic melting pot that empowers the next generation of makers and innovators. We provide students with a pressure-free environment that triggers inspiration, discussion, and hands-on (and often messy) exploration, so that they can foster a mindset geared to create, innovate and lead impactful change.



Our enthusiastic staff members are here to support you with everything SPH related. If you need information about new courses, project support, the makerspace or help with advanced prototypes, just ask!
