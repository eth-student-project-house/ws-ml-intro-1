SPH Project: NAPOLY.ch
Napoly.ch is a shortcut to all exercises, solutions, lecture slides and information for your studies. We aim to put an end to the multitude of websites every student has to navigate in order to get started on their work.

Adjusting to life at ETH can be confusing at times. The sheer amount of websites students need to go through to access working materials and information is overwhelming.

Our goal is to make all relevant learning documents easily available to as many students as possible. This allows them to focus on their studies, making the time spent studying more efficient.

In order to provide this service, the Napoly-team consists of and relies on volunteers from all over ETH, who upload and update content daily.

If you are interested to know how this works or would like to participate in some way, feel free to contact
