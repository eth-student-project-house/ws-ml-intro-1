SPH Project: POLYSINTER
We are a team of students developing a new home SLS 3d printer which enables anyone to print stronger, more detailed and more complex parts than any standard FDM printer could achieve. The printer will be able to print a variety of materials completely without support structures. To improve the environmental impact of 3d printing we are designing new 3d printing materials made out of recycled plastic waste for our printer.
