Locations

For the autumn semester 2022, we have rethought the whole experience. The space is now divided into different areas, each with a specific purpose.

The building was opened in autumn 2021. There are five floors inside. On the D-Floor you will find our <a href="https://sph.ethz.ch/makerspace" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><span class="drawer pink">Makerspace</span></a>, while on the other floors you will find the <a href="https://sph.ethz.ch/events" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><span class="drawer yellow">Event</span></a> and Community Space and our <a href="https://sph.ethz.ch/ideaspace" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><span class="drawer green">Ideaspace</span></a>.
