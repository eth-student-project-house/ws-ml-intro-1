Open Day - FHK

Come and explore our spaces at ETH Zentrum &amp; ETH HÃ¶nggerberg, where you can bring your ideas and projects to life. Make your own products and enjoy free drinks and ice cream in our spaces.

  
  

We invite you to check us out! We support students and their ideas, no matter how big or small thus driving the maker &amp; innovator mindset! ðŸŽ‰

We have multiple activities planned for you, ranging from make-workshops in our makerspace to interacting with projects in our project fair throughout the entire Open Day! Choose the time slot that suits you best and drop in.
