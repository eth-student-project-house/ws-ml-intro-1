SPH Project: bitcypher
__Tired of a select few big companies controlling the data game?__ – bitcypher is here to break up the data monopoly and empower users. 

Our customer-centred peer-to-peer data marketplace for researchers and students is like eBay — but for datasets and better. By combining the security and decentralisation of blockchain with the ease of a centralised data hub, we are creating a world where anyone can access, share, and monetize data.
