SPH Project: GRABIGO
We at GrabIGo are making a digital, refrigerated shelf, which can be used to sell and evaluate food products and drinks. Our app can be used to pay for purchases and also shows personalised ads, surveys and promotions. We currently focus on providing snacks for offices, but we plan to adapt our system to be used in convenience stores and hospital inventory management in the future.
