SPH Project: riverX
<table><tbody><tr><td>Two billion people currently source their drinking water from rivers, yet freshwater ecosystems are the most degraded in the world. Basic information about our freshwater systems, such as <strong>water temperature</strong>, <strong>quantity</strong>, and <strong>clarity</strong>, are missing because these ecosystems are dynamic and because of the lack of affordable measurement systems.<br/>
<br/>
At <strong>riverX</strong>, we collect and provide this freshwater data using a network of self-made sensors, that cost less than traditional sensors on the market.<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in partnering with riverX and if you would like to set up a sensor network in your watershed, then please get in touch.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
