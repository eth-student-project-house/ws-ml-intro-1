SPH Project: FooDi
Changing oneâ€™s (eating) habits is hard and information concerning healthy, eco-friendly diets can be overwhelming and contradicting. Therefore, we want to support people who want to make the change by creating a place for open exchange about environmentally friendly food. FooDi provides a cooking hub to meet, cook and learn from each other.

  

FooDi, the cooking hub, offers a shared kitchen space, where community members can learn by cooking and eating with other food lovers to have a more sustainable and healthy diet. We offer guided and personalized activity on site!

Our goal is to engage and empower individuals to make informed diet choices. Our three pillars are: learn-by-doing, fun and knowledge exchange.

Our team is now composed of of three environmental engineers: Annie, Giovan Battista and Giulia. We are food and nature lovers. With this project, we are trying to combine our two passions!
