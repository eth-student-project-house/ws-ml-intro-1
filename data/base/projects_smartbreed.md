SPH Project: SmartBreed GmbH
SmartBreed manufactures automated breeding boxes for grasshoppers. These can be set up directly at the customer's site and allow zoos, farmers and food manufacturers to produce their own protein. The grasshoppers convert agricultural by-products in the boxes and are then further fed or processed by our customers. An innovative, locally integrated value chain created in this way strengthens the competitiveness of local ag-riculture and offers future-proof and sustainable added value through the circular economy concept.
Our goal is to enable decentralized breeding of grasshoppers directly at our customers. This enables them to breed grasshoppers efficiently and cost-effectively, thus making optimal use of otherwise thrown away resources and closing circular loops.
