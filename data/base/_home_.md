Welcome to Student Project House, a space built for the thriving creative community within ETH. This is where students (hi!) gather, experiment, test out concepts, supercharge group projects and build tomorrow’s ideas, today. Drop in and get started!  

With coworking spaces, networking events, workshops, coaching, and funding opportunities, SPH gives student projects a launchpad to make a real-world impact.

A student-run space with tools and machines for all your self-started projects and prototyping needs. All ETH students – bachelor, master and doctorate – are welcome.
