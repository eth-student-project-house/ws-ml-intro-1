<p>After our opening of the new location at ETH Zentrum in September 2021, it was time to look back at the first five years of the Student Project House. Since the opening of the pilot station at ETH Hönggerberg in 2016, so much has happened, but we hardly took our time to look back. In the beginning, we tried out various different offers, from programs, to workshops and even in our space, we moved our furniture often to adapt to the needs of our students. One can say, we tested, adapted, tested again and thus iterated often. In the same manner as we teach our projects to bring an idea forward. Now, we very clearly know what our offer is, what is unique about it and what students learn by realizing their own ideas at the Student Project House.<br /></p>
