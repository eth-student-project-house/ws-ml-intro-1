SPH Project: PARA PERU
For our climate, for our biodiversity, and for some of the few remaining forest dwelling indigenous tribes on this planet, it is crucial that we support the momentum of existing bottom up initiatives to stop further deforestation in the Amazon. The ‘Paraperu’ project contributes to poverty alleviation of Peruvian Brazil-Nut producers by adding value to their product by using the side stream (waste) of Brazil nut oil production for cosmetics.
