SPH Project: Green Toilet
<table><tbody><tr><td>Nature, as magnificent as we all know it, is down-to-earth, humble, and fits everyone and everything in because it has faith in the power of diversity, collective knowledge, and action. Like this, it has become what it is today. The best thing we have!<br/>

Who are we? We are young people from all corners of the world who voluntarily and respectfully dedicate their time, energy, and resources, to support communities without access to safely managed water and sanitation and reduce environmental pollution. What do we do? We make use of the already existing, free of charge, collective knowledge and action to reduce the suffering of others through collaborative projects. How do we do it? At Green Toilet, Nature-based Sanitation Solutions (NBSS) are coupled with Citizen Science (CS) and Participatory Action to increase public awareness and help improve access to safe sanitation and drinking water and reduce the suffering of rural communities of the global south.
