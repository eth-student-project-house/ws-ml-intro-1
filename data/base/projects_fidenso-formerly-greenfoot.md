SPH Project: Fidenso
Large and complex organisation with a wide range of activities, many employees and multiple branches or departments are struggling to

a) measure their carbon emissions from direct and particularly indirect sources such as procurement, third-party contractors, digital home office emissions and employee commuting,

b) to determine what the financial cost, carbon savings and overall impact on climate change associated with potential reduction and compensating methods are.

Fidenso is building a software accounting tool for sustainability officers to estimate the Scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon emissions of a large organisation with their available data to efficiently and comprehensively complete their annual carbon tracking and to formulate a cost- and carbon-effective strategy for reduction and compensation that can be proposed to the administration.
