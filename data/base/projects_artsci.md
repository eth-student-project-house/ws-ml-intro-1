SPH Project: ArtSci
ArtSci celebrates the intersection of art and science through a two week exhibition held at ETH Zurich. ArtSci (“artsy”) started in 2018 as an idea that science should be accessible to all. At a time when our knowledge of the universe ranges from Higgs bosons to collisions of black holes, it is important to find creative ways to communicate the magic of new discoveries. This festival is open to everyone. Let your mind wander at the exhibition or even submit something yourself -- all that is needed is a piece (visual, auditory, multimedia, etc) that expresses science in an artistic way.
