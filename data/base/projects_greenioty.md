SPH Project: greenioty
Greenioty is an __open source vertical farming__ project. We are creating adaptable and replicable vertical farming systems, that can be installed directly on site, e.g. in restaurants, canteens, supermarkets, or other public spaces. Our goal is to develop urban and vertical farming solutions to produce tastier, healthier, and more sustainable food while sharing all the documentation and data to __enable anyone to produce food anywhere, at any time.__ We want to inspire and influence people to produce and consume better food and are aiming to reduce the huge gap of the current food system between the consumers and the producers.
