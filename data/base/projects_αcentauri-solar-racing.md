SPH Project: alphaCentauri Solar Racing
Î±Centauri Solar Racing is a student-led project founded by engineering students of ETH Zurich. 

We share the passion and vision to design and construct a highly efficient racing-vehicle solely powered by the sun. We are a strong team dedicated to technology and innovation. Our goal is the construction of a solar racing car as set out in the Challenger Class regulations of the Bridgestone World Solar Challenge 2023. And then win the race of course!
