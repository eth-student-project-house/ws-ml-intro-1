SPH Project: TETHYS
Tethys Robotics builds the world's only bionics-inspired underwater drone that can operate autonomously in all waters, finally enabling operations in strong water flows with poor visibility. By this means, we greatly contribute to mitigating significant risks divers face everyday while drastically reducing the needed personnel involved in underwater work.
